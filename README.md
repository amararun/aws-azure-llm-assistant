## LLM Assistant Video & Posts

In my earlier videos and posts, I showed how the Analytics Assistant App works… connecting to and analyzing data on AWS RDS MySQL and Azure MySQL, with table sizes ranging from 1 million to 10 million records… smoothly converting natural language text to SQL… summarizing, merging, and creating customer profiles.

This is similar to a setup I am currently using for a live client use case. This is a barebones version for sharing publicly.

I used a FastAPI server in the middle to allow ease of connectivity to any backend database as well as the front end of our choice.

I’ve deployed this setup on my public website (tigzig.com) using Flowise AI, and I also have a custom GPT version. In both cases, my FastAPI server and backend databases are the same.
